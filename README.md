# My reading notes (class1)

## Little bit about myself:

Hello, thank you for visiting my page
My name is Timothee Odushina. I am an Army veteran with supply logistis and warehouse experience.
I am a Software Developper student at Codefellows and I am very exited to learn new skills.
I love challenging myself and this that is one of the reason I decided to switch to the Tech career.
I will be using Windows 10 system.
I currently live in El Paso, Texas and I love spending time with my family.

 ## Growth mindset
1. Anything is achievable when you put your mind and work into it.
2. Help yourself first before helping others.
3. Never make fun of someone, you may later be going throught the same things.
