 Growth mindset is freedom. Effort is required to build new skills. You strive in challenge and only see the positive way of things. Here are my favorite growth mindset I strive to use at all time:
 
1. Anything is achievable when you put your mind and work into it.
2. Help yourself first before helping others.
3. Never make fun of someone, you may later be going throught the same things.
